# MS-MTO
# Introduction
This is the source code of this article:[Multi-surrogate multi-tasking optimization of expensive problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705120304536) 

Test set is CEC2005 and CEC2017：
| Index | Benchmark problem | Index | Benchmark problem | Index | Benchmark problem | Index | Benchmark problem |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| F1 | Ellipsoid | F2 | Rosenbrock | F3 | Ackley | F4 | Griewank  |
| F5 | Rastrigin | F6 | CEC2005 F10 | F7 | CEC2005 F16 | F8 | CEC2005 F19 |
| F9 | CEC2017 F1 | F10 | CEC2017 F4 | F11 | CEC2017 F11 | F12 | CEC2017 F21 |
